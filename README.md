# PROJECT
Lumpy Skin Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a severe condition affecting cattle, characterized by symptoms such as fever, infertility, decreased milk production, and other health issues. While infected cattle may live for extended periods, predicting the disease early is critical to mitigating economic losses and ensuring effective disease management.

This project employs various machine learning models to predict whether cattle are afflicted with Lumpy Skin Disease. The study evaluates multiple classifiers and computes evaluation metrics to determine their effectiveness. The DenseNet121 CNN model outperformed other models with an impressive accuracy of 95%.
